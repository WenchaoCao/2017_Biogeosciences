## Code folder
The code folder contains a Jupyter notebook with code written in Python 2.7. This notebook contains the data analysis and figure generation code used for the manuscritp. It utilizes standard scientific Python modules as well as modules from the open source PmagPy project (https://github.com/PmagPy/) and pygplates which provides a Python API to the open source GPlates software (https://www.gplates.org/). 

The Jupyter notebook can be viewed as static html here: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Swanson-Hysell/2017_Taconic/blob/master/Code/Taconic_Arc_Paleogeography.html

## Data folder
The data folder contains subfolders related to geological data (`Geology`), GPlates reconstruction files (`GPlates`), the neodymium isotope compilation (`Nd`), the oxygen isotope compilation (`O`), the paleomagnetic data (`Pmag`), and the strontium isotope compilation (`Sr`).
